1. Please download Joern according to the instruction from [`script/readme.md`](../script/readme.md) before proceeding with subsequent operations

2. because joern needs to convert the code in the dataset into C/C++files for CPG conversion, we need to convert the code in the dataset to C file format.

3. then we run the dataprocess.py file to convert the code in the dataset into CPG format.

4. If you have not performed feature extraction before, you can run it directly in approach/run.py or run feature_extraction.py as a separate file to extract features
